2. Fill in the spec with requirements
3. Create the worktree: `./scripts/agents/setup.sh agent-X feature/agent-X/feature-name`

## Notes

- Minions should only work on one feature at a time
- Keep features small enough to complete in 1-2 hours
- Coordinate before assigning work that touches shared code
- Review minion work frequently to catch issues early
