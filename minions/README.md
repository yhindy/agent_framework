# Parallel Minion Missions 🍌

This directory contains documentation and missions for AI minions working on this project in parallel.

## Overview

The system supports multiple parallel minions, each working in isolated git worktrees. Minions can be:

- **Cursor IDE** (background minions)
- **Cursor CLI** (`cursor --folder <worktree>`)
- **Claude Code** (`claude` CLI)
- **Aider** or any other AI coding tool

## Quick Start

**1. Create a Minion Worktree**

```bash
./minions/bin/setup.sh agent-1 feature/agent-1/my-feature
```

This creates an isolated copy of your codebase for the minion to work in.

**2. Start an AI Minion**

Give the minion its mission file:

```bash
# Using Claude Code
cd ../yourproject-agent-1
claude "Read minions/assignments/agent-1-*.md and implement the feature"

# Using Cursor CLI
cursor --folder ../yourproject-agent-1

# Using Cursor IDE
# Just open the worktree folder and start a background minion
```

```

## Creating Missions

1. Copy `templates/FEATURE_SPEC.md` to `assignments/agent-X-feature-name.md`
2. Fill in the feature requirements
3. Create the worktree: `./minions/bin/setup.sh agent-X feature/agent-X/feature-name`
4. Point the AI minion at the mission file

## Managing Worktrees

```bash
# List all minion worktrees
./minions/bin/list.sh

# Remove a worktree when done
./minions/bin/teardown.sh agent-1

# Force remove (discards uncommitted changes)
./minions/bin/teardown.sh agent-1 --force
```

## Best Practices

### For Humans Coordinating Minions

1. **Assign non-overlapping work** - Each minion should work on files that others won't touch
2. **Keep missions small** - Features that can be completed in 1-2 hours work best
3. **Review frequently** - Check minion progress and course-correct early
4. **Merge often** - Don't let branches diverge too far

### For AI Minions

1. **Read your mission first** - The spec file has everything you need
2. **Stay in your lane** - Only modify files listed in your allowlist
3. **Test before committing** - Run tests before every commit
4. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits are easier to review
5. **Ask when stuck** - If requirements are unclear, document the question
